## API Reference

### Programmatic Usage

```python
import frappe

# Create role duplicate document
doc = frappe.new_doc('Role Duplicate')
doc.source_role = 'HR Manager'
doc.new_role_name = 'HR Manager Copy'
doc.description = 'Copy of HR Manager role for testing'

# Load permissions from source role
doc.load_source_role_permissions()
print(f'Loaded {len(doc.role_permissions)} permissions')

# Create the new role with all permissions
result = doc.create_new_role()
print(f'Result: {result}')
```

### API Endpoints

```javascript
// Load permissions from source role
frappe.call({
    method: 'duplicate.duplicate.doctype.role_duplicate.role_duplicate.load_role_permissions',
    args: {
        source_role: 'HR Manager',
        role_duplicate_name: 'ROLE-DUP-2025-00001'
    }
});

// Create new role from duplicate
frappe.call({
    method: 'duplicate.duplicate.doctype.role_duplicate.role_duplicate.create_role_from_duplicate',
    args: {
        role_duplicate_name: 'ROLE-DUP-2025-00001'
    }
});
```

## DocTypes Included

### Primary DocTypes
- **Role Duplicate**: Main interface for role duplication
- **User Permission Manager**: Enhanced user permission management

### Child DocTypes
- **Role Duplicate Permissions**: Stores individual permission details
- **User Permission Details**: Manages user-specific access controls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Role creation shows "Network/Server Error"**
A: Check browser console for detailed error messages. Verify API endpoints are accessible and CSRF tokens are valid.

**Q: Only some permissions are copied**
A: Check for DocTypes that don't exist in the target environment. The system will skip non-existent DocTypes and report them.

**Q: User permissions not applying**
A: Verify the user exists and has the necessary base permissions. User permissions are restrictions, not grants.

**Q: Installation fails with "Can't pickle function" error**
A: This has been resolved in recent versions. The issue was caused by command objects in hooks.py. Update to the latest version which uses Frappe's command auto-discovery.

**Q: Tests fail with "Allow must be set first" validation error**
A: This has been fixed by properly handling Dynamic Link field validation in User Permission Details. The issue occurred when the `allow` field wasn't set before the `for_value` field.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in browser console to see detailed API call information:
```javascript
// Check browser console for detailed logs when using the interface
```
